CHAPTER 01 - PRELIMINARIES
------------------------------------------------------

- Essential Python Libraries

    1. NumPy ('Numerical Python', 2006)
        - Includes fast multidimensional array 'ndarray'
        - Functions for performing computations on elements and arrays
        - Tools for reading and writing data
        - Linear algebra, FFTs, random number generation
        - Mature C API to enable python extensions to native C/C++ code 
            (C/C++ can process ndarray without having to copy to different data structure)
        - Often used as a container to pass data to functions and libraries

    2. Pandas ('Panel Data', 2010)
        - Includes structures designed to make working with structured/tabular data fast
        - 'DataFrame' is a tabular, column-oriented data structure with row column labels
        - 'Series' is a one-dimensional labeled array object
        - Combines efficiency of NumPy with flexible data manipulation of SQL

    3. Matplotlib (2003)
        - Most popular library for creating plots and 2D visualizations
        - Creates large plots suitable for publication

    4. IPython (2001) and Jupyter (2014)
        - IPython = better Python REPL
        - Jupyter uses IPython as a kernel

    5. SciPy (2001)
        - Collection of packages addressing a large number of standard problems in scientific computing
        - scipy.integrate = numerical integration and diff eq solvers
        - scipy.linalg = linear algebra routines not found in numpy
        - scipy.optimize = function optimizers and root finding algorithms
        - scipy.signal = signal processing
        - scipy.sparse = sparse matrix tools
        - scipy.special = wrapper around 'SPECFUN' FORTRAN library
        - scipy.stats = continuous and discrete probability distributions

    6. Scikit-learn (2010)
        - General-purpose machine language toolkit, predictive statistics
        - Classification (SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression)
        - Regression (lasso, ridge regression)
        - Clustering (k-means, spectral)
        - Dimensionality reduction (PCA, feature selection, matrix factorization)
        - Model selection (grid search, cross-validation, metrics)
        - Preprocessing (feature extraction, normalization)

    7. statsmodels (2010)
        - Contains algorithms for inferential statistics and econometrics
        - Regression models (linear regression, linear models)
        - ANOVA (analysis of variance)
        - Time series analysis (AR, ARMA, ARIMA, VAR)
        - Nonparametric methods (kernel density, kernel regression)
        - Visualization of statistical model results
