CHAPTER 10 - DATA AGGREGATION AND GROUP OPERATIONS
------------------------------------------------------

- GroupBy Mechanics

    Hadley Wickham, an author of many popular packages for the R programming language, 
      coined the term 'split-apply-combine' for describing group operations.

      1. Data contained in a pandas object, whether a Series, DataFrame, or otherwise, 
          is split into groups based on one or more keys that you provide. The splitting 
          is performed on a particular axis of an object. For example, a DataFrame can be 
          grouped on its rows (axis=0) or its columns (axis=1). 

      2. Once this is done, a function is applied to each group, producing a new value. 

      3. The results of all those function applications are combined into a result object. 
           The form of the resulting object will usually depend on whatâ€™s being done to the data.


      key  | A   B   C   A   B   C   A   B   C
      data | 0   5  10   5  10  15  10  15  20 
                          |
                          |    SPLIT
                          |
                         \ /

         A   A   A       B   B   B       C   C   C
         0   5  10       5  10  15      10  15  20
                          |
                          |    APPLY
                          |
                         \ /

                         sum()

- Grouping Keys

    Each grouping key can take many forms, and the keys don't all have to be the same
      type.  Different types of keys include:

      1. A list or array of values the same length as the axis being grouped
      2. A value indicating a column name in a DataFrame
      3. A dict or Series giving a correspondence between the values on the axis being grouped
      4. A function to be invoked on the axis index or the individual labels in the index


    # Create a DataFrame
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'key1' : ['a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'],
                           'key2' : ['one', 'two', 'one', 'two', 'one'],
                           'data1' : np.random.randn(5),
                           'data2' : np.random.randn(5)})
    >>> df

          data1     data2 key1 key2
    0 -0.204708  1.393406    a  one
    1  0.478943  0.092908    a  two
    2 -0.519439  0.281746    b  one
    3 -0.555730  0.769023    b  two
    4  1.965781  1.246435    a  one


    # Suppose we want to compute the mean of the 'data1' column using the labels from 'key1'
    >>> grouped = df['data1'].groupby(df['key1'])
    >>> grouped
    <pandas.core.groupby.SeriesGroupBy object at 0x7f85008d0400>

    >>> grouped.mean()

    key1
    a    0.746672
    b   -0.537585
    Name: data1, dtype: float64


    # We can also pass multiple arrays as keys
    >>> means = df['data1'].groupby([df['key1'], df['key2']]).mean()
    >>> means

    key1  key2
    a     one     0.880536
          two     0.478943
    b     one    -0.519439
          two    -0.555730
    Name: data1, dtype: float64

    >>> means.unstack()

    key2       one       two
    key1                    
    a     0.880536  0.478943
    b    -0.519439 -0.555730



- Using numpy Arrays as Grouping Keys

    # Create numpy arrays
    >>> states = np.array(['Ohio', 'California', 'California', 'Ohio', 'Ohio'])
    >>> years = np.array([2005, 2005, 2006, 2005, 2006])
    
    # Use numpy arrays as grouping keys
    >>> df['data1'].groupby([states, years]).mean()

    California  2005    0.478943
                2006   -0.519439
    Ohio        2005   -0.380219
                2006    1.965781
    Name: data1, dtype: float64



- Using DataFrame Columns as Grouping Keys

    Frequently, the grouping information is found in the same DataFrame as the data you want
      to work on.  In that case, you can pass column names as group keys.

    >>> df.groupby('key1').mean()

             data1     data2
    key1                    
    a     0.746672  0.910916
    b    -0.537585  0.525384
    
    >>> df.groupby(['key1', 'key2']).mean()
    Out[22]: 
                  data1     data2
    key1 key2                    
    a    one   0.880536  1.319920
         two   0.478943  0.092908
    b    one  -0.519439  0.281746
         two  -0.555730  0.769023


    In the first case above, 'df.groupby('key1').mean()' did not include 'key2' in the
      grouped data.  This is because 'key2' is not numeric data, so it is said to be a
      'nuissance column', and is therefore excluded from the result.



- Getting Group Sizes

    # The 'size' method is used to get group sizes
    >>> df.groupby(['key1', 'key2']).size()

    key1  key2
    a     one     2
          two     1
    b     one     1
          two     1
    dtype: int64



- Iterating Over Groups

    The 'GroupBy' object is iterable, generating a sequence of 2-tuples containing the 
      group name along with the chunk of data.

    >>> for name, group in df.groupby('key1'):
            print(name)
            print(group)

    a
          data1     data2 key1 key2
    0 -0.204708  1.393406    a  one
    1  0.478943  0.092908    a  two
    4  1.965781  1.246435    a  one

    b
          data1     data2 key1 key2
    2 -0.519439  0.281746    b  one
    3 -0.555730  0.769023    b  two


    In the case of multiple keys, the first element in the tuple will be a tuple of key
      values.

    >>> for (k1, k2), group in df.groupby(['key1', 'key2']):
            print((k1, k2))
            print(group)

    ('a', 'one')
          data1     data2 key1 key2
    0 -0.204708  1.393406    a  one
    4  1.965781  1.246435    a  one

    ('a', 'two')
          data1     data2 key1 key2
    1  0.478943  0.092908    a  two

    ('b', 'one')
          data1     data2 key1 key2
    2 -0.519439  0.281746    b  one

    ('b', 'two')
         data1     data2 key1 key2
    3 -0.55573  0.769023    b  two



- Group Iteration Patterns

    # Compute a dict of data pieces as a one-liner
    >>> pieces = dict(list(df.groupby('key1')))
    >>> pieces['b']

          data1     data2 key1 key2
    2 -0.519439  0.281746    b  one
    3 -0.555730  0.769023    b  two
