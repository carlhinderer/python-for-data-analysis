CHAPTER 10 - DATA AGGREGATION AND GROUP OPERATIONS

- GroupBy Mechanics

    Hadley Wickham, an author of many popular packages for the R programming language, 
      coined the term 'split-apply-combine' for describing group operations.

      1. Data contained in a pandas object, whether a Series, DataFrame, or otherwise, 
          is split into groups based on one or more keys that you provide. The splitting 
          is performed on a particular axis of an object. For example, a DataFrame can be 
          grouped on its rows (axis=0) or its columns (axis=1). 

      2. Once this is done, a function is applied to each group, producing a new value. 

      3. The results of all those function applications are combined into a result object. 
           The form of the resulting object will usually depend on whatâ€™s being done to the data.

                          |    SPLIT
                          |
                         \ /
