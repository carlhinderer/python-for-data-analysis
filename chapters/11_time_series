- Time Series Data

    Many time series are 'fixed frequency', which is to say that data points occur at
      regular intervals according to some rule.  Time series can also be 'irregular',
      without a fixed unit of time or offset between units.  The time series data may
      have one of the following:

      1. Timestamps = specific instants in time, this is the most widely used

      2. Fixed Periods = ie the month January 2007 or the full year 2010

      3. Intervals of Time = indicated by start and end timestamps, periods are a 
                             special case of intervals

      4. Elapsed Time = each timestamp is a measure relative to a particular start time
